### **Intro**
- Git helps us manage our **project** files 
- Git is a tool we install on our __computer__
- Git tracks the branches separately
- Git stores all data in the hidden folder locally, on hard drive.

#### **Terminology**
Project = Repository (repo) - git saves all of the data and history
Working directory - the folder location for the repository
Staging - control what gets committed  
Commit - secondary save


#### **Command**
> git status - see the modified 

> git add -A    - add all changes 
(shows stages that are ready to be commited)

>git commit -m '(msg)'   - successfully commited those change 

>git checkout -- . -to return previous work 

 
> cd (path directory)

> git init (to initialized) 

> git clone https://github.com/LearnWebCode/welcome-to-git.git 

> git remote -v (will show origin clone path- fetch & push)

> git remote set-url origin https://github.com/imeldabumanlag/travel-site.git (make repo the origin)
